Style the component using Tailwind CSS with hover effects. The component should be added to the index page of a React application.\n\nAdditionally, implement a backend with Express.js that provides API endpoints to handle the increase and decrease actions. The backend should also include an endpoint to initialize the counter value.\n\n1. The `Counter` component should call the increase API endpoint when the increase button is clicked, and the decrease API endpoint when the decrease button is clicked.\n2. The component should initially fetch the current counter value from the backend and update its state accordingly.\n3. The backend should have separate routes and handlers for the increase and decrease actions, updating the counter value accordingly.","md5":"c65e7428d9ebb79af071f4c4bec579bd"}]}
